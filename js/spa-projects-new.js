    technical: "The system architecture combines Meta's SAM2 for mask-based object segmentation with Label Studio's annotation interface, creating a semi-automated labeling workflow for generating training data. The detection pipeline utilizes a Temporal Segment Network (TSN) pre-trained model accessed through the MMAction2 computer vision framework, which processes spatio-temporal features across sequential frames. Initially explored 3D CNN architectures for direct spatio-temporal inference, but pivoted to TSN due to computational constraints. The model processes 5-frame temporal windows representing discrete fight moments, with each frame annotated for fighter masks, strike events, and miss classifications. Training was conducted on 200 labeled frames across 40 sequences using transfer learning from pre-trained TSN weights.",
    challenges: "Primary bottleneck was dataset size limitations - only 200 frames across 40 sequences were manually annotated due to Label Studio Premium subscription access issues, which would have enabled automated learning of labeling patterns after 3-4 examples. Initial 3D CNN architecture was abandoned due to excessive RAM requirements that exceeded Google Colab runtime capacity, even with batching optimizations. Manual mask refinement remained time-consuming despite SAM2 automation. Model accuracy remains below production standards due to limited training data, though results were impressive given the constraint of only 40 data points for transfer learning.",
