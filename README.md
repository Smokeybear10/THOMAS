# THOMAS | Personal Portfolio

A single-page portfolio site with custom SPA routing, interactive 3D models, and scroll-driven animations. No frameworks — vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, and CSS.

## Quick Start

```bash
# no build step — just serve the files
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## What It Does

Five routes handled by a custom hash-based SPA router with animated transitions, per-route cleanup, and lazy asset loading.

**Home**
- Typing animation with name and title
- Interactive 3D cube built in Three.js with drag controls and momentum physics
- Hovering nav links swaps the displayed 3D animal model in real-time

**About**
- Bio section with expandable tools/skills dropdown
- Languages, frameworks, databases organized by category

**Experience**
- Dual-panel layout: left side shows rotating 3D animal heads (horse, bull, lion) that swap based on which section is scrolled into view
- Education timeline (Penn — Master's in CS, Bachelor's in Math/Statistics)
- Professional experience cards (Visa, Astera Holdings, Flushing CPA)
- Research cards (Penn CURF, Princeton Plasma Physics Lab)
- Scroll-driven section focus dimming — only the active section is bright

**Projects**
- Rotating wheel carousel for featured projects
- Full-screen modal with image gallery, tech stack, and links
- Six projects: Strike Detection ML, D4NCE, FightIQ, this portfolio, MontePoker, SmartCV

**Contact**
- Email, LinkedIn, GitHub links with SVG icons and Three.js background

## How the Router Works

Each route registers an `onEnter` and `onExit` callback. On navigation, the router fades out the current content, swaps the visible `[data-route-content]` div, runs the new route's initialization (3D model loading, scroll listeners, animations), and fades in. On exit, it tears down event listeners and disposes Three.js resources to prevent memory leaks across route changes.
